# brian talks about angular with lots of data

This is my lightning talk about performance considerations for
Angular apps displaying lots of data.

It starts with a simplified explanation of `$digest` and then gives a few
examples of how to apply this knowledge.


## Measure things

Seriously you probably want to measure to make sure you know what's slow.


## What factors are important?

### DOM manipulation

Why?

* Causes [reflows][]
* Lots of strategies [DOM manipulation][]

Angular is pretty good at helping you with this.
In some cases you can write your own directive to

### dynamic things

The number of "dynamic things" your user sees.
This is actually called `$watch`.


## Counting Dynamic Things

Consider the following chunk of an app:

```html
<div>
  <p>{{thing}}</p>

  <div ng-repeat="item in items">{{item.name}}</div>
</div>
```

Here's a list of the things Angular thinks might update:

```javascript
// angular figures this out based on directives, which add `$watch`s
var thingsThatMightUpdate = [
  $scope.thing,

  // from ngRepeat
  $scope.items.length,
  $scope.items[0], // obj refs
  $scope.items[1],
  $scope.items[2],
  $scope.items[3],

  // from {{item.name}} inside ngRepeat
  $scope.items[0].name, // values
  $scope.items[1].name,
  $scope.items[2].name,
  $scope.items[3].name,
];
```

*(This is all psuedocode btw)*


## Digest cycle

This is a simplification.
[The docs on scopes have the full story](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope).

```javascript
// map thingName to value
var oldValues = {
  '$scope.thing': 'hello',
  '$scope.items.length': 4,
  /* ... */
};

function digest () {
  var thingsThatChanged;
  do {
    thingsThatChanged = [];

    thingsThatMightUpdate.forEach(function (thing) {
      if (oldValue[thingName] !== $scope[thingName]) {
        thingsThatChanged.push(thingName);
        oldValue[thingName] = $scope[thingName];
      }
    });

    // trigger `$watch`s, updating the DOM, etc

  } while(thingsThatChanged.length > 0);
}
```

tl;dr â€“ watch fewer things


## Make it faster

Here's a few strats.

### Paginate

ngRepeat over a subset of the things.

Controller:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('MyController', [
  '$scope', function ($scope) {

    // this has like a million elts
    $scope.bigArray = [ /* ... */ ];

    $scope.page = 0;

    $scope.$watch('page', function (index) {
      $scope.littleArray = $scope.bigArray.slice(index, index + 5);
    });

  }]);
```

Template:
```html
<div>
  <div ng-repeat="item in littleArray">{{item.name}}</div>
  <button ng-click="prev -= 1">prev</button>
  <button ng-click="page += 1">next</button>
</div>
```

You can use a similar strategy but with [infinite][infinite scrolling]/[virtual][virtual scrolling]
scrolling.


### You know the data is populated once

* [bind-once (coming to 1.3 soon)](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5408)

[this article](http://blog.scalyr.com/2013/10/31/angularjs-1200ms-to-35ms/)

### You know the data is populated occasionally

Opt out of data binding; use event listeners.

In your controller:
```javascript
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('MyController', [
  '$scope', '$interval', '$http', function ($scope, $interval, $http) {

    // this has like a million elts
    $http.get('all-the-things.json').success(function (data) {
      $scope.$broadcast('dataUpdated', data);
    });
  }]);
```

In your directive:
```javascript
//
{
  link: function (scope, elt) {
    scope.$on('dataUpdated', function (ev, data) {
      // do DOM manipulation
    });
  }
}
```


## Summary

Angular makes the 95% case fast, but gives you the tools to take control of your own performance
destiny when you want to.
